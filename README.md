### What is this Project in three sentences? ###

This is web application that is intended to shorten the time it takes for people to find different Data Sets.
We want to empower users to find their data faster to answer interesting questions that pertain to their area of interest.
This project will also target to be a Tableau Web Connector as soon as Tableau releases the API.

### User Stories
Hypothetical User Stories that help build the scope and vision of this project.  

#### Jane the Social Scientist
Suppose Jane is a social science researcher.  Her current project is to compare and contrast the crime activity
statistics between different States within the USA.  She uses the Socrata Connector to search for criminal data
for different cities within the United States.  Instead of panning around Google diving into different different
government websites, Jane is able to utilize SocrataConnector search functionality.  She is able to find crime
data sets for different cities in the fraction of the time using a common search engine.

#### Curious Joe

Curious Joe is looking to understand more about his local community.  He find that the local media and the people he speaks
